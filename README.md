## Description
A VWAP algorithm that attempts to beat the VWAP price (i.e tries to get a price for you that is better than what the market is executing at)
The following user parameters must be defined:
- ```product_id``` - the ticker you want to trade (i.e BTC-USD)
- ```side``` - either 'buy' or 'sell'
- ```hours``` - how many hours you want the execute the order over
- ```orderqty``` - size (i.e 1 BTC)
- ```limit``` - a hard limit on all orders
When running the code, the following inputs are entered via the user from the command prompt

## Getting Started
It's pretty simple, you'll need to get an authenticated client setup first on your Coinbase Pro account so you're "hooked-in" appropriately.
- The ```authenticated_client.py``` script is where you'll need to put your relevant keys and is a nice & easy way to switch between virtual trading and live trading. If you need help on how to do this, please refer to the following repo (https://github.com/danpaquin/coinbasepro-python)
- Now run ```python coinbase_algo.py```
